@section Incompatible Changes from 1.3
This version has changes that break compatibility with the 1.3 versions of the
@emph{matio} software. This section lists these changes and how existing code
should be modified to handle these changes.
@enumerate
@item dims field of matvar_t structure changed to size_t *
@item MEM_CONSERVE preprocessor definition removed
@item BY_NAME and BY_INDEX renamed
@item Added @code{MAT_} prefix to enumerations of @code{matio_compression}
@item Changed name of structure for complex split-format data from
      @code{struct ComplexSplit} to @code{struct mat_complex_split_t}
@item Changed name of sparse data structure from @code{sparse_t} to
      @code{mat_sparse_t}.
@item Changed meaning of memory conservation for cell arrays and structures
@end enumerate
Each of these changes are described in the remaining sections, and as necessary
include recommendations to upgrade existing code for compatibility with this
version.

@subsection Type Change for Dimensions Array
The existing dims field of the @code{matvar_t} structure was an @code{int *}
which limited the maximum size of a dimension to @math{2^{31}}. In version 1.5,
the type was changed to @code{size_t *} which allows a variable of length
@math{2^{31}} on 32-bit systems, but @math{2^{64} - 1} on 64-bit system. To
upgrade to version 1.5, all existing code should ensure the use of @code{dims}
allows for @code{size_t}, and that any use of the @code{Mat_VarCreate} function
passes an array of type @code{size_t} and not @code{int}. Not upgrading to
@code{size_t} is likely to produce segmentation faults on systems where
@code{sizeof(size_t) != sizeof(int)}.

@subsection Removed Preprocessor Flag to Conserve Memory
Previous versions of the @emph{matio} library had a preprocessor macro
@code{MEM_CONSERVE} that was passed as an option to @code{Mat_VarCreate} to tell
the library to only store a pointer to the data variable instead of creating a
copy of the data. Copies of scalars or small arrays are not critical, but for
large arrays is necessary. In version 1.5, this macro has been changed to the
enumeration value @code{MAT_F_DONT_COPY_DATA}. A quick search/replace can
quickly upgrade any references to @code{MEM_CONSERVE}. Alternatively, since
@code{MAT_F_DONT_COPY_DATA} has the same value as @code{MEM_CONSERVE}, software
using @emph{matio} can simply define @code{MEM_CONSERVE} to 1.

@subsection Renamed Structure Field Lookup Enumerations
The @code{BY_NAME} and @code{BY_INDEX} enumerations are used by
@code{Mat_VarGetStructField} to indicate if the field is retrieved by its name,
or by its index in the list of fields. To bring these into a @emph{matio}
namespace and hopefully avoid conflicts, these have been renamed to
@code{MAT_BY_NAME} and @code{MAT_BY_INDEX}. A quick search/replace operation
should be able to correct existing code that uses the old names.

@subsection Memory Conservation with Cells and Structures
Previous versions of @emph{matio} would still free fields of structures and
elements of cell arrays even if created with memory conservation flag set. In
the latest version of @emph{matio}, the fields/cell elements are not free'd if
the structure was created with the @code{MAT_F_DONT_COPY_DATA} flag. This is
useful if the fields/elements are referenced by another variable such as the
case when they are indices of a larger array (i.e. @code{Mat_VarGetStructs},
@code{Mat_VarGetStructsLinear}).
